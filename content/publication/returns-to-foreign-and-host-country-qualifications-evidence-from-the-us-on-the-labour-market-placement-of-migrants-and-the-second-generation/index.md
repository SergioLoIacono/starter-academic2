abstract: "The integration of migrants in the US economic system is a central
  concern of policy-makers and scholars. A faster and smoother assimilation of
  valuable human capital would indeed benefit the labour market, increasing its
  efficiency. To investigate the integration of minorities and migrants in the
  US labour market, we employ data from the Current Population Survey from June
  2016 (the primary source of labour force statistics in the US). We focus on
  the following ethnic groups: White, Black, Asian, and Other (a combination of
  Native Americans, Pacific and Mixed). For each ethnicity we consider if
  respondents are US born, 1st- or 2nd-generation of immigrant descent. Among
  1st-generation migrants, we further differentiate between recent (in the
  country for 10 years or less) and long (in the country for more than 10 years)
  arrivals, as they are likely to have different levels of social capital and
  knowledge of the job market. We focus on three very relevant labour market
  outcomes: being employed, being employed in a public sector job and working in
  a professional or managerial position. Our results indicate better placement
  of individuals with tertiary degrees, an effect particularly important among
  women. Minorities in the public sector have made some important gains in terms
  of occupational attainment parity with the white majority."
