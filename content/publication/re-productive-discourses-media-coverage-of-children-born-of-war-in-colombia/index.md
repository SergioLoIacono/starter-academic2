abstract: Children born as a result of wartime sexual violence have not gained a
  place in the stories covered by the Colombian media. Based on an extensive
  content analysis (using the software MAXQDA 12) of newspaper articles
  published between 1990 and 2015, ethnographic content analysis, and drawing
  upon feminist critical discourse analysis, this paper explores how information
  about these children is presented as part of storylines that use the
  explanatory framework of sexual violence as a weapon of war. In those
  storylines, children emerge not as independent subjects but as part of social
  representations of female victims of wartime sexual violence and male
  perpetrators.
