title: Does community social embeddedness promote generalized trust? An
  experimental test of the spillover effect

publication_short: In *Social Science Research*
abstract: Despite the theoretical relevance attributed to the spillover effect,
  little empirical research has focused on testing its causal validity.
  Addressing this gap in the literature, I propose a novel experimental design
  to test if the overall density of social links in a community promotes
  trustworthy and trusting behaviors with absolute strangers. Controlling for
  social integration (i.e. the individual number of social connections), I found
  that density fosters higher levels of trust. In particular, results show that
  people in denser communities are more likely to trust their unknown fellow
  citizens, encouraging isolated subjects to engage with strangers. However,
  evidence did not support the idea that community social embeddedness causes an
  increase of trustworthiness, indicating that the spillover effect works only
  with respect to trust.
