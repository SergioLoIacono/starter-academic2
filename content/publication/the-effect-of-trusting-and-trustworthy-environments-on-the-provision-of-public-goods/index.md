abstract: "Trusting and trustworthy environments are argued to promote
  collective action, as people learn to rely on their fellow citizens and
  believe that only few individuals will free ride. To test the causal validity
  of this mechanism, we propose an experimental design that allows us to create
  different trusting and trustworthy conditions simply by (i) manipulating the
  incentive structure of an iterated binary trust game and (ii) allowing
  information to flow among participants. Findings indicate that, given a
  similar distribution of resources among subjects, trusting and trustworthy
  environments strongly foster the provision of public goods. This outcome is
  largely driven by a learning effect: subjects transfer what they assimilate
  during a sequence of dyadic exchanges to their decision to act for the
  collectivity. In particular, results showed that what we learn from the
  community has a relevant effect on our ability to overcome the free-rider
  problem: we are more likely to act for the collectivity when we learn from the
  community to be trustful or reliable in our one-to-one interactions. The same
  applies in the opposite direction: we are more prone to free ride when we
  learn from the environment to be distrustful or unreliable in our dyadic
  exchanges."
