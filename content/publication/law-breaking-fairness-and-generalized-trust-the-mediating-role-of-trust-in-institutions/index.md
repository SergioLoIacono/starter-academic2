abstract: Institution-centered accounts of generalized trust rely on the idea
  that law-breaking and state’s unfairness lower individuals’ propensity to
  trust fellow citizens because of a weaker confidence in the state. Despite the
  theoretical relevance attributed to this mediation mechanism, no empirical
  analysis in the literature has focused on examining its correlational
  validity. Using data from the European Social Survey (2010), the Quality of
  Government EU Regional data, and EUROSTAT, this paper assesses the intervening
  role of institutional trust on the relationship between crime rates, state’s
  fairness, and generalized trust. Results from a Multilevel SEM (MSEM)
  mediation analysis indicate that trust in institutions strongly mediates the
  relationship between violent crimes (i.e. homicide) and generalized trust but
  not the one between property crimes (i.e. vehicle thefts and robberies) and
  generalized trust. On the other hand, indicators of fairness (i.e.
  impartiality and corruption) are all mediated by institutional trust, though
  impartiality maintains a significant direct effect. Overall, findings support
  the institutional approach, confirming that the negative relationship between
  ineffective and unfair institutions and generalized trust passes mostly
  through people’s lost faith in the state.
