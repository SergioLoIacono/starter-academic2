The aim of this volume is to examine the role of trust in public life. It seeks to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of certain fundamental concepts in political and legal theory, such as the concepts of authority, power, social practice, the rule of law, and justice by furnishing and sharpening our concepts of trust and trustworthiness. Trust has been relatively neglected in Anglophone philosophy and in legal theory. Bringing together contributors from across the social, cognitive, historical, and political sciences, this volume seeks to open up inquiries into central concepts in legal theory to new approaches and methodologies. It is an interdisciplinary collection of essays in which the notions of trust, trustworthiness, and distrust are analysed and applied in addressing a variety of problems and sets of questions. This volume aims to place analytic questions about the attitude of trust and the virtue of trustworthiness at the centre of a cross-disciplinary inquiry about their value.
