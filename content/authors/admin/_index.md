I am a postdoctoral researcher in Sociology at Utrecht University. In my work, I investigate how we can build sustainable societies that foster cooperation, while identifying what institutional and environmental factors facilitate such an outcome. 

I focus on the role of social networks, learning processes, wealth inequality, and sanctioning institutions in the emergence of trust and pro-sociality, paying particular attention to discriminated minorities and their integration in the society.
