I am a postdoctoral researcher in Sociology at Utrecht University. My work mostly investigates how we can build sustainable societies that foster cooperation, while identifying what institutional and environmental factors facilitate such an outcome. 

I focus on the role of social networks, learning processes, wealth inequality, and sanctioning institutions in the emergence of trust and pro-sociality, paying particular attention to discriminated minorities and their integration in the society.
