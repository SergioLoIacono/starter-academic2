  <p> 
I am a postdoctoral researcher in Sociology at Utrecht University. In my work, I investigate what institutional and ecological factors facilitate cooperation and the development of sustainable societies.
  </p>
  <p> 
I focus on the role of social networks, learning processes, wealth (in)equality, and sanctioning institutions in the emergence of trust and pro-sociality. In doing so, I assess how discriminated minorities can be smoothly integrated in the society.
